**What is GSD**

**Introduction**
GSD is the acronym to *Get Shit Done*, GSD.go is a simple tool to automatize a lightweight version of the GTD method.


**First stage**
Following the GTD method we will collect all inputs (all things we want to do). We create a list with a description of what we want to do

**second stage**
we process the list :
Does I need to do something ?
  YES : 
    Where do I start ?
     set the first  action to be done, expressed it with current language.
     Then choose :
      * do it now, if it can be done quickly (less than 2 minutes)
      * delegate it, if you can not do it yourself or if it need someone else input.
      * post pone it, if it's too complex, it need an element that is not ready yet... Document it. Perhaps you ought to create a project and sliced in 
        smaller actions. Put all actions in you favorite tracking tool (GSD of course ! ) **Here I need more information/explanation on how to create a project.**
  NO :
    Should I trash it ?
    Should I delay it and review it again later ?
    Should I put it in archives ?

**third stage**
When everything is processed you should have a list of project to be done(things you have to do), a "wait for" list (things you are waiting other to do) 
and a perhaps list (things you maybe will done)

**fourth stage**
Get shit done !

**fifth stage**
review GSD and feed it with your new idea.
